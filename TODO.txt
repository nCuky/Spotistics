3. Multi-Threading - when fetching large quantity of data, optimize performance so that it fetches using multi processing.


* column function - from all listen data, for every combination of Artist+Track+Album, find how many instances exist.

---Audio Features---
* All Zappa songs - columns graph by key

---Observed problems regarding data standardization:---
* Track that was replace with its "Remastered" version is considered a new separate track than the original one,
 even though I want to count it as the same track. This was solved by getting the RelinkedTrackID for each track
 and determining the "Track Known ID" according to it.
* Track that was a "Single" taken from another album, but its "Album Name" got the value of the "Single"'s name.
 This may be solved by getting, alongside the Relinked Track ID, the Relinked Album ID, and overriding the DataFrame with it.
 This is dangerous and I don't want to do it right now.




----done---
* make sure the API returns ALL items and not only the first 100 - send 'offset' parameter to the API function calls
rewrite all functions so that they use this new logic.
* GUI - 'get audio features' button -> show graph
* Standardize the TrackKnownID for each listened track.

* Ver.1: Always search for the "original" track ID, saved in 'linked_from' object of a Track.
See more info here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/track-relinking-guide/
  In short, need to get the relinked_id for every track, and then put alongside the "track_id" already there (considered the "original_id").
* Ver.2: This is difficult, as no TrackID can be considered "the original". The relinked ID is relative to market and there is no single
market that I can depend on, which is considered "the absolute" market.
Also, it is not 100% guaranteed that there will even be a 'LinkedTrack' for a given track, even if it reasonably "should" be.
Instead, I use the combination of "Artist name + Album name + Track Title", known as "TrackCombo".
* Ver.3: Compromise and final decision:
0. *** IMPORTANT NOTICE *** The philosophical question of "What is considered a Song" is a very complicated question
which I can't and won't solve right now.
1. For every "TrackCombo", collect all distinct track_id values and put them in an Array for that TrackCombo.
2. Create a new column in the 'all_tracks' dataframe, named 'unified_track_id'
